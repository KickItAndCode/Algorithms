# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence
# Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

# A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some
# characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining
#  characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common
#  subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.


def longestCommonSubsequence(str1, str2):
    pass


print(longestCommonSubsequence("abcde", "ace"))  # 3 ace
print(longestCommonSubsequence("abc", "abc"))  # 3 abc
print(longestCommonSubsequence("abc", "def"))  # 0
print(longestCommonSubsequence("ZXVVYZW", "XKYKZPW"))  # 3 XYZW
