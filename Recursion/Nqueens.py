# 51. N-Queens

# The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an nÃ—n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

# Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

# Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

# Example:

# Input: 4
# Output: [
#  [".Q..",  // Solution 1
#   "...Q",
#   "Q...",
#   "..Q."],

#  ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
#   "Q...",
#   "...Q",
#   ".Q.."]
# ]
# Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.
