# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

# (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

# You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

# You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

# Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
# Output: 4
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
# Output: -1

# 4 5 6 7 0 1 2
# 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

#       l r


def search(nums, target):

    if not nums:
        return -1

    l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2

        if target == nums[mid]:
            return mid

        if nums[l] <= nums[mid]:
            if nums[l] <= target <= nums[mid]:
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        else:
            if nums[mid] <= target <= nums[r]:
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                r = mid - 1
    return -1


print(search([4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], 0))  # 4
print(search([4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], 3))  # -1
